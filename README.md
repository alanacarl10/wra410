# Assignment: One HTML and CSS

I have made all of the required changes. How I did so will be detailed here. 
## Required Changes to WRA 410

1. Make changes to the background color of a page and a div.
  I changed the footer color using the footer div. I was not sure if the instructions wanted the container or the whole page a different color. I just changed the whole body color of all of the pages just to be safe. 

2. Use a new font.

 I changed the font on all of the pages, including the homepage in the CSS using the body. 

3. Include two images.

I included two images on the policies page. In the CSS, it is referenced as #main img. 

4. Use a table to format the Grading Scale on the Assignments page.

I used to a regular table for the grading scale in html and added details in CSS (table, th,td). I made it look more professional by using margins. However, I think there was some type of typo for the grading scale for 2.5. It is the same as 3.0, but I was unsure fi you wanted that changed. 

5. Reformat the Student Groups. Use a different color for links, add a title for each group, separate each student. Use multiple columns for the divs.  

Added a different color for the links using the a tag. Used a random team name generator to add titles and used headings to separate everything. There are now two rows and three columns.  

6. Add navigation to the Schedule webpage.

Added a sticky navigation on the webpage using the position as a fixed. Made the navigation font bigger than the others. 

7. Revise the rows and columns on the Schedule webpage so the information is clearer or prettier.

Used borders and got rid of some borders to make the navigation easier. Added top headers to make it known what column was what. Used html headings to separate the week from the days. Centered the text.
